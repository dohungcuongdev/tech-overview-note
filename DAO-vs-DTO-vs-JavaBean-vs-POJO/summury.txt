DTO is an abbreviation for Data Transfer Object, so it is used to transfer the data between classes and modules of your application.

DAO is an abbreviation for Data Access Object, so it should encapsulate the logic for retrieving, saving and updating data in your data storage (a database, a file-system, whatever).

A POJO (plain-old-Java-object) isn't rigorously defined. It's a Java object that doesn't have a requirement to implement a particular interface or derive from a particular base class, or make use of particular annotations in order to be compatible with a given framework, and can be any arbitrary (often relatively simple) Java object.

A JavaBean follows certain conventions. Getter/setter naming, having a public default constructor, being serialisable etc
A JavaBean must:
- Have All properties private (use getters/setters)
- Have A public no-argument constructor
- Implement Serializable.
