Indexes create a separate file where the records are sorted in a binary tree.
The lookup for records then becomes a binary search operation, as opposed to a full table scan,
making it extremely faster to lookup records by an indexed field.

MySQL doesn't have filtered indexes
CREATE INDEX fake_table_index ON table_name (inactive, column_name);

MSSQL support filtered indexes
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX FIBillOfMaterialsWithEndDate  
    ON Production.BillOfMaterials (ComponentID, StartDate)  
    WHERE EndDate IS NOT NULL ;  
GO
