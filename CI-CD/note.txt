The CI/CD pipeline is one of the best practices for devops teams to implement, for delivering code changes more frequently and reliably

The technical goal of CI is to establish a consistent and automated way to build, package, and test applications. 
With consistency in the integration process in place, teams are more likely to commit code changes more frequently, 
which leads to better collaboration and software quality.

Continuous delivery picks up where continuous integration ends. CD automates the delivery of applications to selected infrastructure environments. 
Most teams work with multiple environments other than the production, such as development and testing environments, 
and CD ensures there is an automated way to push code changes to them.
