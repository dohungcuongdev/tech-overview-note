After each sprint, we will have sprint goal, that would be the completed peice of application which we can run and demo for customer. The meeting with customer at the end of each sprint would be called "Sprint Review"
After Sprint Review, Scrum Master and the team may have a meeting to evaluate, to review what did good, what did bad to learn from mistake and grow up after each Sprint. this meeting is called "Sprint Retrospective"
The Sprints may repeat after finished all the story in Product Backlog. At the end product owner may decide end project or continue depend on situation.
