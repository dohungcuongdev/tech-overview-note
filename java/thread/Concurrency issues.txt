Concurrency issues:

Threads have their own call stack, but can also access shared data. Therefore you have two basic problems, visibility and access problems.
A visibility problem occurs if thread A reads shared data which is later changed by thread B and thread A is unaware of this change.
An access problem can occur if several thread access and change the same shared data at the same time.
Visibility and access problem can lead to:
Liveness failure: The program does not react anymore due to problems in the concurrent access of data, e.g. deadlocks.
Safety failure: The program creates incorrect data.
