/**
 * Quicksort
 * 
 * Worst complexity: n^2
 * Average complexity: n*log(n)
 * Best complexity: n*log(n)
 * Space complexity: log(n)

The Quicksort steps are:
Pick an element, called a pivot, from the list.
Reorder the list so that all elements with values less than the pivot come before the pivot, while all elements with values greater than the pivot come after it (equal values can go either way). After this partitioning, the pivot is in its final position. This is called the partition operation.
Recursively sort the sub-list of lesser elements and the sub-list of greater elements. The base case of the recursion are lists of size zero or one, which never need to be sorted.

Like Merge Sort, QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different ways.
Always pick first element as pivot.
Always pick last element as pivot (implemented below)
Pick a random element as pivot.
Pick median as pivot.
The key process in quickSort is partition(). Target of partitions is, given an array and an element x of array as pivot, put x at its correct position in sorted array and put all smaller elements (smaller than x) before x, and put all greater elements (greater than x) after x. All this should be done in linear time.

Compare with Merge Sort: Quicksort is likely considered better
Auxiliary Space : Mergesort uses extra space, quicksort requires little space and exhibits good cache locality. Quick sort is an in-place sorting algorithm. In-place sorting means no additional storage space is needed to perform sorting. Merge sort requires a temporary array to merge the sorted arrays and hence it is not in-place giving Quick sort the advantage of space.
Worst Cases : The worst case of quicksort O(n2) can be avoided by using randomized quicksort. It can be easily avoided with high probability by choosing the right pivot. Obtaining an average case behavior by choosing right pivot element makes it improvise the performance and becoming as efficient as Merge sort.
Locality of reference : Quicksort in particular exhibits good cache locality and this makes it faster than merge sort in many cases like in virtual memory environment.
Merge sort is better for large data structures: Mergesort is a stable sort, unlike quicksort and heapsort, and can be easily adapted to operate on linked lists and very large lists stored on slow-to-access media such as disk storage or network attached storage. Refer this for details
