SPA not good SEO

with SPA, The content is instead loaded on demand from the server with AJAX and then added to the page by JavaScript.
SPA  allows a user to view the "pages" of an SPA site without a page refresh, theoretically improving UX.
While this architecture works for human users viewing the page in a browser, what about search engine crawlers? Can crawlers run JavaScript? 
If so, will they wait for the AJAX calls to complete before crawling the page?
It's important to know this, as it could determine whether or not the site's content is indexable by a search engine, 
and just as importantly, how well its content is ranked.

googlebot maybe cannot crawler data from SPA and in this case it cannot render your page
a page can be indexed, doesn't mean it will rank well
