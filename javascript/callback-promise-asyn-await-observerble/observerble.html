  <h1>Promise vs Observable</h1>
  <pre>
  Promise

	A Promise handles a single event when an async operation completes or fails.
	Note: There are Promise libraries out there that support cancellation, but ES6 Promise doesn't so far.

	Observable
	An Observable is like a Stream (in many languages) and allows to pass zero or more events where the callback is called for each event.
	Often Observable is preferred over Promise because it provides the features of Promise and more. With Observable it doesn't matter if you want to handle 0, 1, or multiple events. You can utilize the same API in each case.
	Observable also has the advantage over Promise to be cancelable. If the result of an HTTP request to a server or some other expensive async operation isn't needed anymore, the Subscription of an Observable allows to cancel the subscription, while a Promise will eventually call the success or failed callback even when you don't need the notification or the result it provides anymore.
	Observable provides operators like map, forEach, reduce, ... similar to an array
	There are also powerful operators like retry(), or replay(), ... that are often quite handy.
	
	
	Note: According to my tests, a Promise is more performant than an Observable.

const myPromise = new Promise(resolve => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve('dog');
    resolve('cat');
    resolve('bird');
  }, 100);
});

myPromise.then(result => {
  console.log('promise: ', result); // result return only 'dog' because promise only support passing only one event
})

const myObservable = new Rx.Observable(observer => {
  setTimeout(() => {
	// Observable allows to pass zero or more events where the callback is called for each event.
    observer.next('dog');
    observer.next('cat');
    observer.next('bird');
  }, 100);
});

const subscription1 = myObservable
  .subscribe(result => {
    console.log('subscription1-observable: ', result); // result return dog, cat, bird
  });
  
  
const subscription2 = myObservable
  .filter(result => result === 'bird') // Observable support filter
  .subscribe(result => {
    console.log('subscription2-observable: ', result); // result return only bird
  });
  
const subscription3 = myObservable
  .filter(result => result === 'bird')
  .subscribe(result => {
    console.log('subscription3-observable: ', result); // this will not be printed because subscription3 is unsubscribed
  });

subscription3.unsubscribe(); // Observable support unsubscribe
