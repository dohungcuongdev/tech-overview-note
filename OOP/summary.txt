OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.
Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:
OOP is faster and easier to execute
OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
OOP helps to keep the Java code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time

Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming

Encapsulation: make sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from users
Inheritance: one class is allow to inherit the features(fields and methods) of another class
Polymorphism: allows to perform a single action in different ways (Ex: People people = new Student(), Override: same method name, same params/Overload: same method name, different params)
Abstraction: hiding unnecessary details (Ex: how a methods work internally) from the user, just show necessary feature (Ex: methods) to user
