Java Abstract Classes and Methods
Abstraction main goal is to handle complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user. 
That enables the user to implement more complex logic on top of the provided abstraction without understanding or even thinking about all the hidden complexity.
Users don't need to care about the complex implementation, don't need to know how the methods work internally, just need to know how to use the methods

Abstraction can be achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces

The abstract keyword is a non-access modifier, used for classes and methods
Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).
Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from).

An abstract class can have both abstract and regular methods

An interface is a reference type in Java. It is similar to class. It is a collection of abstract methods. A class implements an interface, thereby inheriting the abstract methods of the interface. Along with abstract methods, an interface may also contain constants, default methods, static methods, and nested types.
interfaces have only abstract methods unless they are delcared as default interfaces (java8)

Tính trừu tượng trong Java là tính chất không thể hiện cụ thể mà chỉ nêu tên vấn đề. 
Đó là một quá trình che giấu các hoạt động bên trong và chỉ hiển thị những tính năng thiết yếu của đối tượng tới người dùng
