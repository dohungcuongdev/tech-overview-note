Git revert to a commit 

Make sure you are on the branch where the commit is. I’m doing this on master.
Then use git reset –hard <commit-hash> to set the current branch HEAD to the commit you want.

(‘git log’ to get the commit) 
git reset --hard cedc856
git push --force origin master 
When we push the change to origin when need to use force
