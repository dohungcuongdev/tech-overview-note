If you have already pushed your branch somewhere or someone pulled from you, your only option is to git revert $COMMIT....
This will create a commit that undoes whatever you've done in commit(s) $COMMIT....
For example, to revert the last three commits:
git revert HEAD~2..HEAD

If you have kept your commits entirely local and private, you can simply  git reset $COMMIT.
This will move your branch pointer to $COMMIT so the branch no longer includes the following commits.
Depending on the state of your index and working tree, you might want any of the options git reset --soft $COMMIT or git reset --hard $COMMIT.
For example, to reset your branch to the commit before the last three:
git reset HEAD~3

git rebase: reapply new commits in a branch on top of another branch.
You use it when you want to copy or "move" some commits from one commit that they are based on, to be based on another commit (another base), hence "rebase".
