JSPs are servlets defined using static content (such as HTML) mixed with Java code. A JSP file will be compiled into a servlet class
Controller extends HttpServlet -> Override doGet (handle a GET request), doPost (handle a POST request)
in the Controller, use RequestDispatcher to forward JSP (or redirect to URL)
maps the request with the servlet in the web.xml file
web.xml configure JSP mapping, servlet-mapping, servlet init param, context-param (which can be read from all servlets in your application), error-page, filter
All the code above will be packaged into war file
start up tomcat with a war file in webapps foler inside Tomcat
In your servlet container, the JSP servlet is mapped to any URL that ends in .jsp (usually)
When one of those .jsp URLs is requested, the request goes to the JSP servlet. Then, this servlet checks if the JSP is already compiled.
If the JSP is not compiled yet, the JSP servlet translates the JSP to some Java source code implementing the Servlet interface. Then it compiles this Java source code to a .class file. This .class file usually is located somewhere in the servlet container's work directory for the application.
Once the JSP servlet has compiled the servlet class from the JSP source code, it just forwards the request to this servlet class.
