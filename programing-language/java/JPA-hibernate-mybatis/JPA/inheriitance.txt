1. use @MappedSuperclass

Example: 
@MappedSuperclass
public class Person {
 
    @Id
    private long personId;
    private String name;
 
    // constructor, getters, setters
}

@Entity
public class MyEmployee extends Person {
    private String company;
    // constructor, getters, setters 
}

If we're using this strategy, ancestors cannot contain associations with other entities.
that means we cannot have any class that Person can extend (inherite)


2. use @Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.SINGLE_TABLE)
