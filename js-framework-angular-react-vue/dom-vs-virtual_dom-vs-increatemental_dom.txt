1/ Dom
HTML DOM (Document Object Model)
When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.
The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects

With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:
JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page

Virtual Dom used by React, Vue
React, Vue uses this intermediate representation (which they call “Virtual DOM”) so that they can diff changes between different states, 
and make changes to a minimal amount of browser DOM nodes.

A virtual DOM object is a representation of a DOM object, like a lightweight copy.
Manipulating the DOM is slow. Manipulating the virtual DOM is much faster

It’s a step that happens between the render function being called and the displaying of elements on the screen.

How Virtual Dom work?
Component render, Create a Virtual Dom
if you make any changes in component, the Virtual Dom get updated. At any state, react keep 2 different versions of Virtual Dom: updated version and pre-update version (snapshot)
Compare updated version with the snapshot using diffing.
Update only different nodes in real DOM.
Assign updated version Virtual Dom as snapshot for the next update.
